# elmkit üå≥ - Lightweight LLM ToolKit

A lightweight, modular toolkit for building LLM-powered applications.  
Designed to cover the core functionality most projects need, without unnecessary complexity.

## Overview
elmkit provides a small set of focused utilities for:
- Interacting with LLM APIs (sync + async)
- Structuring messages for API calls
- Defining and executing tools
- Tracking usage, latency, and cost
- Token and cost calculation helpers

It is **not** a framework ‚Äî just the essential building blocks to help you move quickly while keeping your codebase clear and maintainable.
